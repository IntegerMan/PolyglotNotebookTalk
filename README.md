# Polyglot Notebook Talk
This code contains code examples for [Matt Eland's](https://MattEland.dev) [Interactive Notebooks](https://stirtrek.com/speakers/2023/Matt-Eland.html#abstract) talk

The contents of this notebook should explain themselves to a limited degree if you start at `00_Welcome.dib` and then move through each of the folders in sequential order.

This code is intended to be viewed inside of `VS Code` using the `Polyglot Notebook` extension and the `Jupyter Notebook` extension. Additionally, you will need to have the `.NET SDK version 7` installed for Polyglot to work correctly and a Python environment installed for the Jupyter content to work correctly. I recommend `Anacondas` as an easy way to get a Python environment suitable for data science installed.

## Additional Resources

### Official Documentation

The team is still building out the [Polyglot Notebooks documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs), but that documentation is growing.

### My Content

I write and speak about Jupyter Notebooks, Polyglot Notebooks, and various topics related to this talk including:

- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- ML .NET
- Azure Cognitive Services
- Azure Machine Learning

#### [AccessibleAI.dev](https://AccessibleAI.dev) - My Data Science Blog

Anything new on the data science aspects of Polyglot Notebooks generally goes here.

#### [NewDevsGuide.com](https://NewDevsGuide.com) - My Software Engineering Blog

This site has a lot of content around **Mermaid diagrams** in particular that should help you understand how to get started with Mermaid in Polyglot Notebooks.

I also will sometimes use Polyglot Notebooks to teach programming concepts or introduce Polyglot Notebooks as a means of experimenting and proving a proof of concept.

If you're looking for recorded video content on topics like this.

This talk will eventually exist as a series of videos on that channel.
