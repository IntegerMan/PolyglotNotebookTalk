# Polyglot Notebook Talk
This code contains code examples for [Matt Eland's](https://MattEland.dev) [Interactive Notebooks](https://stirtrek.com/speakers/2023/Matt-Eland.html#abstract) talk

The contents of this notebook should explain themselves to a limited degree if you start at `00_Welcome.dib` and then move through each of the folders in sequential order.

This code is intended to be viewed inside of `VS Code` using the `Polyglot Notebook` extension and the `Jupyter Notebook` extension. Additionally, you will need to have the `.NET SDK version 7` installed for Polyglot to work correctly and a Python environment installed for the Jupyter content to work correctly. I recommend `Anaconda` as an easy way to get a Python environment suitable for data science installed.

## Running the Code

### Step 1: Install VS Code

If you don't have it already you'll need Visual Studio Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This is cross-platform, free, and amazing.

### Step 2: Install Anaconda

Installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) will give you a local **Python** environment pre-configured with common libraries already installed along with **Jupyter Notebooks** and **Jupyter Labs**.

Go to [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/) and click **Download** then install it on your operating system.

You may need to reboot after this step.

### Step 3: Install .NET 7 Locally

If you want to use **Polyglot Notebooks** and the **.NET Interactive** kernel, you need to install the .NET SDK from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).

### Step 4: Install VS Code Extensions: Jupyter and Polyglot Notebooks

You'll need to install the [Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) in order to run standard Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.

In order to use Polyglot Notebooks, you'll need to install the [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

You may need to reboot your machine or restart VS Code after these steps.

### Official Documentation

The team is still building out the [Polyglot Notebooks documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs), but that documentation is growing.

### My Content

I write and speak about Jupyter Notebooks, Polyglot Notebooks, and various topics related to this talk including:

- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- ML .NET
- Azure Cognitive Services
- Azure Machine Learning

Anything new on the data science aspects of Polyglot Notebooks generally goes here.

#### [NewDevsGuide.com](https://NewDevsGuide.com) - My Software Engineering Blog

This site has a lot of content around **Mermaid diagrams** in particular that should help you understand how to get started with Mermaid in Polyglot Notebooks.

I also will sometimes use Polyglot Notebooks to teach programming concepts or introduce Polyglot Notebooks as a means of experimenting and proving a proof of concept.

If you're looking for recorded video content on topics like this.

This talk will eventually exist as a series of videos on that channel.
