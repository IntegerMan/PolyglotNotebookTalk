# Polyglot Notebook Talk
This code contains code examples for [Matt Eland's](https://MattEland.dev) [Interactive Notebooks](https://stirtrek.com/speakers/2023/Matt-Eland.html#abstract) talk

The contents of this notebook should explain themselves to a limited degree if you start at `00_Welcome.dib` and then move through each of the folders in sequential order.

This code is intended to be viewed inside of `VS Code` using the `Polyglot Notebook` extension and the `Jupyter Notebook` extension. Additionally, you will need to have the `.NET SDK version 7` installed for Polyglot to work correctly and a Python environment installed for the Jupyter content to work correctly. I recommend `Anacondas` as an easy way to get a Python environment suitable for data science installed.
